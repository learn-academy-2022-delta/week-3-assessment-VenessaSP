<!------------ First mistake I found: 
   Were the opening and closing tags, figured since the whole scope was red there must be something missing from the top, and realized it wasn't encapsulated.

   ------------ Second mistake I found line: 67
  Even though the red cleared up I still got an error message: 
  'Inline Babel script:49 Uncaught ReferenceError: drawCard is not defined'
Don't understand because there's a function that was made and it matches the onClick on line 71 and no error was throw'n for that.

---------------- Third mistake honestly couldn't find
I was thinking the closing tag </>
